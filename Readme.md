# README

Some [pyautogui](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui) based scripts made to clear out my subscriptions (over 700 of them ðŸ˜²) and 'watch later' playlist (Which I had forgotten existed and therefore had over 200 videos from 2-3 years ago, none of which I intend to go back and watch.)

# Important

- This worked for me on 27 Dec 2018 with 1920x1080p resolution in firefox 64.
- If anyone else wishes to use these scripts just adjust the coordinates (depending on resoultion) and wait times (depending on internet connection and computer speed)
- **WARNING**: these programs run in an infinite loop, please utlize pyautoguis FAILSAFE by dragging mouse to top left cornerof screen to quit
